   Branches of Philosophy </h1>
Philosophy deals with fundamental questions. But which questions, specifically, is philosophy about? Here’s a standard categorization:
<ul>

  <li>  Logic: Logicians study good and bad arguments and reasoning, and they study formal, symbolic languages intended to express propositions, sentences, or arguments.
  </li><br>
<li>Metaphysics: Metaphysicians study what sorts of entities exist, what the world and its constituents are made of, and how objects or events might cause or explain each other.
  </li><br>
<li>Epistemology: Epistemologists study knowledge, evidence, and justified belief. An epistemologist might study whether we can trust our senses and whether science is trustworthy.
  </li><br>
<li>Values: In value theory, philosophers study morality, politics, and art, among other topics. For example: What makes wrong actions wrong? How do we identify good people and good lives? What makes a society just or unjust?
  </li><br>
    </ul>
