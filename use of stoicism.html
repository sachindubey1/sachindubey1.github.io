<p>The real world of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is stressful. There is always something more to accomplish, <br>
  something better to do, to achieve a bit extra. 
  <br>There is no end to our desires and ambitions.
  <br>If only we could slow down a bit. 
  <br>If you achieve a lot of materialistic stuff 
  <br>but lose all your mental peace would that make you satisfied?</p>



<p>Implement Stoic practices in your life to make it simpler and enjoyable.<br>
  Here are 10 useful Stoic Exercises you can practice daily to lead a better life.</p>



<h3>1. Stop controlling things</span>
</h3>



<p>There are things under your control and there are things beyond your control.<br>
  Try understanding this fact if you want to be happy in life. For instance,<br>
  you have no control over how your boss treats you. But you have control in searching for a new job.</p>



<p>Don’t try to control things which are not in your hands.<br>
  The more you will try to make things happen, the more complexities you will create for yourself.<br>
  Stop trying to be the control freak.</p>



<p>You can change certain things but not all.<br>
  Whenever you are anxious, take some deep breaths and then think about the situation in hand. <br>
  Can you do something about it? Yes? Then start taking action. <br>
  If not, close your eyes, do a prayer and leave it to the universe or the higher power you believe in.</p>



<p>Sometimes we don’t find a solution immediately.<br>
  But it appears later on. <br>
  So, keep your calm and wait for the solution to arrive.<br>
  If you can’t find an answer don’t panic.<br>
  It will come to you sooner or later. Have patience.</p>



<h3>2. Protect your time</span>
</h3>



<p>Time is the most important factor in life.<br>
  If you constantly misuse it, you will never do anything of importance.<br>
  Observe how you spend your day.<br>
  The things you do every day, the shows you watch, or the people you meet frequently. <br>
  Do you need to spend time on such activities and people?</p>



<p>Answer honestly. Start protecting your time.
  <br>You can ask yourself before doing anything –<br>
  Is it really necessary?<br>
  If not, don’t do it. Simple!</p>



<p>Read books on <a>time management</a>.<br>
  Prepare a To-Do list at night for the next day. <br>
  Jot down the most important things you need to do.<br>
  As the day progresses keep ticking off your list. <br>
  That way you will have a direction. <br>
  Start spending time on things that matter to you.</p>



<p>Most of us waste a lot of time browsing the internet and scrolling on social media.<br>
  Be vigilant of how you are using your time. <br>
  You have accessibility to all types of entertainment in your fingertips.<br>
  But does that mean you should be watching a movie every single day?<br>
  Make sure you consume no more than 2-5% of your time in entertainment.<br>
  For instance, watch a movie once a month, not every day or even every weekend.</p>



<h3>3. Spend time in self-reflection</span>
</h3>



<p>Most of us sleepwalk through our lives.<br>
  How many of us pause to reflect? Wise people analyze their lives.<br>
  They deeply reflect on whatever is happening in their lives.</p>



<p>Before going to bed, sit, and think about how the day was spent.<br>
  In a journal write down the good and positive results you got for the day.<br>
  Then think about what didn’t go well.<br>
  Write those down. <br>
  Now reflect on why those things didn’t go well. <br>
  Do you need to change the way you deal with people?<br>
  Is it that you need to communicate more clearly Or, <br>
  it could be anything else. Jot it down.</p>



<p>In your leisure time read your journal.<br>
  Start implementing the ideas you have generated there.<br>
  Your life will definitely start improving.</p>



<h3>4. Seek happiness within you</span>
</h3>



<p>Do you seek happiness in external events and people?<br>
  If your happiness depends on your accomplishments,<br>
  money or even your spouse, you will get more pain than pleasure in life;</p>



<p>You have to center yourself. <br>
  Take action towards your goals but do not stay attached to your goals.<br>
  Similarly, love people, have a good time with them but never rely on them for happiness.<br>
  For no one can make you happy but yourself.</p>



<p>Take life as it comes. <br>
  Do not unnecessarily complicate things by setting unrealistic expectations on things or people. <br>
  As we discussed already, there is no point trying to control people or things.<br>
  When you expect people or situations to bring you happiness, <br>
  you are just falsely raising your hopes.</p>



<p>It is your responsibility to stay happy and motivated.<br>
  You are sufficient for bringing happiness into your life!<br>
  Dive into your inner self. Practice meditation,<br>
 and read biographies of inspiring men and women. <br>
  You have to take some action towards finding the path of happiness.<br>
  The more you connect with your inner essence the more you will remain content in life.</p>



<h3>5. Stay focused</span>
</h3>



<p>Most of the time, our mind just wanders aimlessly like a vagabond.<br>
  If you can control your mind you will win half the battle!<br>
  That is to say,<br>
  life becomes extremely simple and enjoyable when you have a grip on your thought processes.</p>



<p>All great scientists, artists, writers, philosophers and sages have one thing in common. <br>
  They have an intensely focused mind.</p>



<p>If you want to lead a fulfilling life and want to make it worthwhile, <br>
  start putting all your attention in the things you do.<br>
  If you are working your attention should be there<br>
  and while having dinner you should focus on your food,<br>
  not on your work.<br>
 Meditation can increase your focus.</p>



<h3>6. Leave your ego</span>
</h3>



<p>If you have a lot of ego you will never be satisfied in life.<br>
  Whatever you will achieve will never be enough for you. <br>
  Also, you will not enjoy it when others achieve success.<br>
  We all are here to live only for a limited span.<br>
  So, shed your pride and fancy.</p>



<p>Have self-respect but that does not mean craving for attention or<br>
  expecting that people will always please you.<br>
  You can have a unique understanding of life<br>
  but maybe everyone will not appreciate that.<br>
  Accept it.</p>



<h3>7. Stand for your virtues</span>
</h3>



<p>Set your standards. Hold your virtues confidently.<br>
  Let no one divert you from your set standards.<br>
  For instance, if you are a punctual person never change it for others.<br>
  Make people understand that you value your time. <br>
  So, if someone wants to attend a meeting after the destined time<br>
  you can politely refuse them.</p>



<p>When something is virtuous for you, protect it. <br>
  Do not compromise on your values, no matter what.</p>



<h3>8. Be open to all types of situations in life</span>
</h3>



<p>Life is unpredictable. It never follows a linear path. <br>
  Unpleasant things happen in life. <br>
  Instead of feeling depressed just start taking things as they come.</p>



<p>Always things will not happen according to your taste.<br>
  When we experience good things unexpectedly our hearts fill up with joy.<br>
  But when unexpectedly bitter things come our way, we feel miserable.<br>
  You have to hold this belief that life will bring your share of both joy and pain.</p>



<p>Heartache, betrayal, loss of money, crisis,<br>
  illnesses and death visit us in our path of life.<br>
  As a true Stoic, hold a realistic approach towards life.<br>
  Optimism can bring you pain.<br>
  On the other hand, if you hold a realistic approach towards life, <br>
  you will always be ready to deal with every situation that arrives.</p>



<h3>9. Practice philanthropy</span>
</h3>



<p>Contribute to society. You should not live only for yourself.<br>
  Do something good for others because your existence is not only for fulfilling your ends. <br>
  Make a decision today to help others in some way.</p>



<p>To practice philanthropy, you don’t have to be rich.<br>
  Each person has something to offer.<br>
  You can lend your service for free to help others.<br>
  As you start becoming a giver,<br>
  you start enjoying life better.</p>



<h3>10. Connect yourself to nature</span>
</h3>



<p>We are a part of Mother Nature.<br>
  With the advancement of technology, we have become distant to nature.<br>
  Cultivate a daily habit to connect yourself to nature.<br>
  It could be walking bare-footed on the grasses in the morning,<br>
  or sitting on the beach listening to the crashing waves or<br>
  watching the changing colors of the sky in the evening.</p>



<p>Make sure to ground yourself every day.<br>
  By doing so you connect yourself with the Source or <br>
  Higher Power and in the process you start realizing the meaning of your existence.</p>
