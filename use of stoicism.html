</h2>



<p>The real world of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is stressful. There is always something more to accomplish, something better to do, to achieve a bit extra. There is no end to our desires and ambitions. If only we could slow down a bit. If you achieve a lot of materialistic stuff but lose all your mental peace would that make you satisfied?</p>



<p>Implement Stoic practices in your life to make it simpler and enjoyable. Here are 10 useful Stoic Exercises you can practice daily to lead a better life.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-stop-controlling-things"><span id="1_Stop_controlling_things">1. Stop controlling things</span>
</h3>



<p>There are things under your control and there are things beyond your control. Try understanding this fact if you want to be happy in life. For instance, you have no control over how your boss treats you. But you have control in searching for a new job.</p>



<p>Don’t try to control things which are not in your hands. The more you will try to make things happen, the more complexities you will create for yourself. Stop trying to be the control freak.</p>



<p>You can change certain things but not all. Whenever you are anxious, take some deep breaths and then think about the situation in hand. Can you do something about it? Yes? Then start taking action. If not, close your eyes, do a prayer and leave it to the universe or the higher power you believe in.</p>



<p>Sometimes we don’t find a solution immediately. But it appears later on. So, keep your calm and wait for the solution to arrive. If you can’t find an answer don’t panic. It will come to you sooner or later. Have patience.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-protect-your-time"><span id="2_Protect_your_time">2. Protect your time</span>
</h3>



<p>Time is the most important factor in life. If you constantly misuse it, you will never do anything of importance. Observe how you spend your day. The things you do every day, the shows you watch, or the people you meet frequently. Do you need to spend time on such activities and people?</p>



<p>Answer honestly. Start protecting your time. You can ask yourself before doing anything – Is it really necessary? If not, don’t do it. Simple!</p>



<p>Read books on <a href="https://themindfool.com/effective-time-management-skills-that-you-must-learn/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">time management</a>. Prepare a To-Do list at night for the next day. Jot down the most important things you need to do. As the day progresses keep ticking off your list. That way you will have a direction. Start spending time on things that matter to you.</p>



<p>Most of us waste a lot of time browsing the internet and scrolling on social media. Be vigilant of how you are using your time. You have accessibility to all types of entertainment in your fingertips. But does that mean you should be watching a movie every single day? Make sure you consume no more than 2-5% of your time in entertainment. For instance, watch a movie once a month, not every day or even every weekend.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-spend-time-in-self-reflection"><span id="3_Spend_time_in_self-reflection">3. Spend time in self-reflection</span>
</h3>



<p>Most of us sleepwalk through our lives. How many of us pause to reflect? Wise people analyze their lives. They deeply reflect on whatever is happening in their lives.</p>



<p>Before going to bed, sit, and think about how the day was spent. In a journal write down the good and positive results you got for the day. Then think about what didn’t go well. Write those down. Now reflect on why those things didn’t go well. Do you need to change the way you deal with people? Is it that you need to <a href="https://themindfool.com/improve-your-verbal-communication-skills/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">communicate more clearly</a>? Or, it could be anything else. Jot it down.</p>



<p>In your leisure time read your journal. Start implementing the ideas you have generated there. Your life will definitely start improving.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-seek-happiness-within-you"><span id="4_Seek_happiness_within_you">4. Seek happiness within you</span>
</h3>



<p>Do you seek happiness in external events and people? If your happiness depends on your accomplishments, money or even your spouse, you will get more pain than pleasure in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have to center yourself. Take action towards your goals but do not stay attached to your goals. Similarly, love people, have a good time with them but never rely on them for happiness. For no one can make you happy but yourself.</p>



<p>Take life as it comes. Do not unnecessarily complicate things by setting unrealistic expectations on things or people. As we discussed already, there is no point trying to control people or things. When you expect people or situations to bring you happiness, you are just falsely raising your hopes.</p>



<p>It is your responsibility to stay happy and motivated. You are sufficient for bringing happiness into your life! Dive into your inner self. Practice meditation, <a href="https://themindfool.com/self-love-affirmations/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">affirmations</a>, and read biographies of inspiring men and women. You have to take some action towards finding the path of happiness. The more you connect with your inner essence the more you will remain content in life.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-5-stay-focused"><span id="5_Stay_focused">5. Stay focused</span>
</h3>



<p>Most of the time, our mind just wanders aimlessly like a vagabond. If you can control your mind you will win half the battle! That is to say, life becomes extremely simple and enjoyable when you have a grip on your thought processes.</p>



<p>All great scientists, artists, writers, philosophers and sages have one thing in common. They have an intensely focused mind.</p>



<p>If you want to lead a fulfilling life and want to make it worthwhile,&nbsp; start putting all your attention in the things you do. If you are working your attention should be there and while having dinner you should focus on your food, not on your work. <a href="https://themindfool.com/spirit-guide-meditation/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Meditation</a> can increase your focus.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-leave-your-ego"><span id="6_Leave_your_ego">6. Leave your ego</span>
</h3>



<p>If you have a lot of ego you will never be satisfied in life. Whatever you will achieve will never be enough for you. Also, you will not enjoy it when others achieve success. We all are here to live only for a limited span. So, shed your pride and fancy.</p>



<p>Have self-respect but that does not mean craving for attention or expecting that people will always please you. You can have a unique understanding of life but maybe everyone will not appreciate that. Accept it.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-stand-for-your-virtues"><span id="7_Stand_for_your_virtues">7. Stand for your virtues</span>
</h3>



<p>Set your standards. Hold your virtues confidently. Let no one divert you from your set standards. For instance, if you are a punctual person never change it for others. Make people understand that you value your time. So, if someone wants to attend a meeting after the destined time you can politely refuse them.</p>



<p>When something is virtuous for you, protect it. Do not compromise on your values, no matter what.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-be-open-to-all-types-of-situations-in-life"><span id="8_Be_open_to_all_types_of_situations_in_life">8. Be open to all types of situations in life</span>
</h3>



<p>Life is unpredictable. It never follows a linear path. Unpleasant things happen in life. Instead of feeling depressed just start taking things as they come.</p>



<p>Always things will not happen according to your taste. When we experience good things unexpectedly our hearts fill up with joy. But when unexpectedly bitter things come our way, we feel miserable. You have to hold this belief that life will bring your share of both joy and pain.</p>



<p>Heartache, betrayal, loss of money, crisis, illnesses and death visit us in our path of life. As a true Stoic, hold a realistic approach towards life. Optimism can bring you pain. On the other hand, if you hold a realistic approach towards life, you will always be ready to deal with every situation that arrives.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-practice-philanthropy"><span id="9_Practice_philanthropy">9. Practice philanthropy</span>
</h3>



<p>Contribute to society. You should not live only for yourself. Do something good for others because your existence is not only for fulfilling your ends. Make a decision today to help others in some way.</p>



<p>To practice philanthropy, you don’t have to be rich. Each person has something to offer. You can lend your service for free to help others. As you start becoming a giver, you start enjoying life better.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-connect-yourself-to-nature"><span id="10_Connect_yourself_to_nature">10. Connect yourself to nature</span>
</h3>



<p>We are a part of Mother Nature. With the advancement of technology, we have become distant to nature. Cultivate a daily habit to connect yourself to nature. It could be walking bare-footed on the grasses in the morning, or sitting on the beach listening to the crashing waves or watching the changing colors of the sky in the evening.</p>



<p>Make sure to ground yourself every day. By doing so you connect yourself with the Source or Higher Power and in the process you start realizing the meaning of your existence.</p>
